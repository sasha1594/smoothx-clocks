Important 
---------

These clock files are tested on Kubuntu 15.04, Plasma 5 and the screenshots are also from the same.

If you are going to try in Plasma KDE 4, it may not look the same as screenshot, since you are advised to try it locally with my smoothx theme, before you attempt to go systemwide.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These clock files are to replace the original in your theme.
These clocks will best suit glass, dark themes with dark wallpaper.
which I created for my own use and shared the same if you will be interested.

please backup your original theme clock before you copy

just copy the clock.svgz file from the appropriate folder into your theme folder.

for systemwide 
it will be in the /usr/share/plasma/desktoptheme/your-theme-folder/widgets/ for this you will need sudo power. and please do it with utmost care.

for personal use
/home/your-name/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/theme-folder/widgets/

Also you may have to clear the cache.. for which
open a terminal ( Konsole )

rm -r ~/.cache/plasma-svg*
rm -r /var/tmp/kdecache-$USER
rm ~/.config/Trolltech.conf

then logout and login.
